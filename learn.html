comma , - 1) Commas are used to separate things in a list
	Example: When Jimmy went to the zoo, he saw a lion, a tiger, and a penguin.
	2) Commas are also used to separate two independent clauses when a conjuntion is used
	Example: Jimmy wondered why there was a penguin in the tiger cage, and he decided to ask the zookeeper if the penguin was in the correct place.
	3) Commas are used between an independent clause and a dependent clause
	Example: As jimmy was looking for the zookeeper, he noticed the penguin waddle away and jump into its own cage.
	4) Commas are used to separate a non-restictive (non-essential) part of the sentence.
	Example: The penguin, which was black and white in color, seemed to be very content with its life in the zoo.
